Many Chinese people are coming to Korea to engage in espionage and incite the news. Please spread the word. You can tell by looking up Korean news or other foreign political news a little bit that this is true. We like to be liberal and democratic like America. We don't want to be oppressed like communism.

        "When iShowSpeed ​​wanted to cut his hair in a barber shop in China, Miles Moretti deliberately maliciously translated the meaning of a barber. Originally, the word \"Zhang Bian\" has no derogatory meaning in China, and it means a cool hairstyle. It only represents a hairstyle culture, and many Chinese people also like to keep \"Zhang Bian\" hairstyle to show that they are cool and handsome.  The barber just said that \"Zhang Bian\" is very difficult to trim, and he will not cut such hair.  But Miles Moretti deliberately translated it as because iShowSpeed's hair is too dirty and messy, and the barber hates such hair, so he is reluctant to cut hair.  From this incident, we can see that Miles Moretti is a despicable and shameless villain with a dark heart. He may be racist himself and deliberately provokes conflicts and opposition between Chinese and American netizens. This Miles Moretti is already so bad!",

        "I don’t know if those in the comments section have ever been to North Korea. According to tourists who have visited, when you go there, you really do have someone following you everywhere during your tour—you have zero freedom. The guides will take you through the most prosperous and beautiful parts of North Korea. Conversely, as a foreign tourist, you’re completely prevented from seeing the poorer, more impoverished areas and people. Speed’s trip in China is just like in North Korea. In China, my hometown is a very non-modernized rural village. My parents earn $300 a month. So I personally believe these videos are all scripts arranged by China for Speed. He’s like a puppet on strings—maybe paid, maybe not. China is nothing like what’s shown in the videos. China is currently very backward. We don’t have Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Sony, or Nintendo. What China does have is the ability to build blocks and set up facades, making every foreigner who visits feel like China has already become modernized and powerful. The real China can only be understood if you come here yourself. When you actually visit China, you’ll discover that everything is fake—none of it is truly high-tech!\r\n\r\nSpecial note: Except for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing, Qingdao, Xiamen, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Ningbo. I hope foreign friends will avoid visiting these cities,Because these cities are the 'Brahmin caste' of Chinese cities.",

        "20岁就成为全球千万级网红。怎么会是空穴来风呢？他超高流量的背后藏不住的是炽热温暖的心。十七岁就成为百万富翁的他，连线遇到的糖尿病男孩，尽管不知道什么是糖尿病但他听到自己是他治疗期间唯一的精神支柱时，他毫不犹豫的伸出援手。无家可归的流浪汉，美国街头摆摊的华人爷爷，印度独自拉扯孩子长大的单亲妈妈。随处的帮助不是炫富，而是验证了那句，我随身带钱不是为了想花钱而是为了想分给某个人。他在中国行的过程中打破了西方对中国的刻板印象。让大家认识了真正的中国。流量的巨潮也许会卷席而过，善良真诚却经久不衰。\nAt the age of 20, he became a global internet celebrity with tens of millions of followers. How could it be groundless? Behind his super high traffic, he can't hide his fiery and warm heart. He became a millionaire at the age of 17. When he connected with a diabetic boy he met online, he didn't know what diabetes was, but when he heard that he was the only spiritual support for the boy during his treatment, he didn't hesitate to lend a hand. Homeless vagrants, Chinese grandfathers selling food on the streets of the United States, and single mothers who raised their children alone in India. Helping everywhere is not showing off wealth, but verifying the saying that I carry money with me not to spend it but to share it with someone. During his trip to China, he broke the Western stereotype of China. Let everyone know the real China. The huge tide of traffic may pass by, but kindness and sincerity will last forever.（I translated these using a machine, so there may be some errors.）",

        "Hello 🙏, God, you are a wonderful legend, 🙏 sorry for writing to you. God, how I love you and your creativity. My life without your creativity has no right to exist, thank you for what you do. I pray to God, please help me. I live in Ukraine. It's very difficult for me. My dream is to go to school, but my father is seriously ill and my mother is elderly. At the moment I work as a cleaner for $56 a month, I swear to me very hard. I don’t buy meat or new clothes; all the money I earn goes to utilities and cereals. We don’t even buy bread, I fry lean cakes. I'm preparing porridge. I don’t feel as sorry for myself as for the parents who are suffering because of the war. I could never even afford to buy perfume, even the cheapest. One day I was given a sample of Avon 3 ml and I tried to extend it for the whole year. In our house I try to keep it clean and tidy. Every Sunday we go to church with our parents and pray to God for peace on earth. My mother is a former nurse, my father once worked as a nurse. I dream of becoming a cook and lawyer. I also know how to sew toys, knit clothes, embroider, and make jewelry. But I never had material for this; I learned everything at school a long time ago. I hope you see my letter, please forgive me for my story. I ask you as before God, help please, it's very difficult for me. I can't understand why people suffer so much. ❤️❤️🙏",

It is REAL. now, we all know  she does OF. while i am not in support of her life choices, i don't think she should of been treated the way she was with speed. what people chose to do with THIEIR OWN PERSONAL LIFE shouldn't reflect who they are as people. especially if they treat you well and being respectful. which she was. The level of immaturity from speed and his fan base is ridiculously high. It's sad to see how cruel the world can be when they come together and hide behind social media. I think she should have just left. You'all would believe in the weirdest shit but a woman with huge hips is capping? you'all be tripping!",

In actual races, sprinters lunge forward like ostriches with every step because they swing their arms back with violent force. Noah didn’t show any of that. I would say this was not him cruising though, more like a good conditioning run. Speed isn’t slow either—he could probably hit mid-11s in a pro 100m right now. I would like to see if he is above or below that. I’d love to see it.",

I do not want you to miss out on the better days you’ve suffered patiently to have. So wait a little longer, and please and make it to next year…\n\nIf you have ever seen my old comments with positive messages and a “I’ll see you in December” in bold at the end, it’s time for me to be specific about what I was talking about. Around the end of the month, I will release a motivational video that will help us move forward in 2025. This video will also talk about my sudden “disappearance” and why I’m returning. If enough people let other people know about this, there will be a guaranteed chance that it’ll go viral for the right reasons.

        "Grooming Safety Steps\n\nGrooming is an essential part of personal hygiene and pet care. However, improper grooming practices can lead to infections, injuries, or discomfort. Following safety measures ensures a safe and effective grooming process. Below are detailed grooming safety steps for personal, pet, and professional grooming.\n\nI. Personal Grooming Safety (Hair, Skin, Nails, and Shaving)\n\n1. General Hygiene and Preparation\n\nWash Hands and Tools: Always wash your hands before grooming and disinfect tools such as razors, combs, and nail clippers.\n\nUse Personal Grooming Items: Avoid sharing grooming tools to prevent infections and cross-contamination.\n\nCheck for Skin Conditions: Examine your skin, scalp, or nails for cuts, rashes, or infections before grooming.\n\nEnsure Proper Lighting: Good visibility is crucial, especially when using sharp objects like scissors or razors.\n\nUse a Clean and Dry Surface: Perform grooming on a clean surface to prevent bacterial growth.\n\n2. Hair Care Safety\n\nUse the Right Tools: Use clean brushes, combs, and sharp scissors for safe trimming.\n\nAvoid Overusing Heat: Excessive use of heat styling tools can damage hair and burn the scalp. Always use a heat protectant spray.\n\nBe Cautious When Cutting Hair: Trim small sections at a time to avoid mistakes or injuries.\n\n3. Skin Care and Shaving Safety\n\nWash Your Face and Body Before Grooming: Clean skin prevents dirt from entering pores during shaving or exfoliation.\n\nUse Sharp Razors: A dull blade increases the risk of cuts and irritation. Always replace razors as needed.\n\nShave in the Direction of Hair Growth: This reduces irritation and prevents ingrown hairs.\n\nApply Moisturizer: After shaving, apply a moisturizer or aftershave to soothe the skin.\n\nAvoid Shaving Over Cuts or Irritated Skin: This prevents infections and further irritation.\n\n4. Nail Care Safety\n\nTrim Nails Carefully: Use a proper nail cutter and avoid cutting too close to the skin to prevent bleeding.\n\nFile Nails Smoothly: Use a nail file to smooth rough edges and prevent accidental scratches.\n\nSanitize Tools After Each Use: Always clean nail clippers and files to avoid bacterial growth.\n\nMoisturize Cuticles: Dry cuticles can lead to cracks and infections. Apply cuticle oil or hand lotion regularly.\n\nII. Pet Grooming Safety (Dogs, Cats, and Other Pets)\n\n1. Preparation and Hygiene\n\nCalm the Pet Before Grooming: Use soothing words, treats, or gentle strokes to relax the animal.\n\nUse Pet-Safe Grooming Products: Human shampoos and conditioners can be harmful to pets. Always use pet-friendly products.\n\nEnsure Proper Restraint: Use a grooming leash or a stable, non-slip surface to prevent sudden movements.\n\n2. Brushing and Hair Trimming Safety\n\nUse the Right Brush: Different pets require different types of brushes (e.g., slicker brushes for long-haired pets, rubber brushes for short-haired pets).\n\nTrim Fur Carefully: Use blunt-tipped scissors to avoid accidental cuts if the pet moves unexpectedly.\n\n3. Bathing Safety\n\nUse Lukewarm Water: Hot water can burn the pet’s skin, while cold water can cause discomfort.\n\nRinse Shampoo Thoroughly: Leftover shampoo can cause itching and irritation. Ensure all soap is washed off.\n\nDry Properly: Use a pet-safe towel or hair dryer on a low setting to avoid overheating.\n\n4. Nail Trimming Safety\n\nUse Pet-Specific Nail Clippers: Human nail clippers can splinter a pet’s nails.\n\nTrim Small Sections at a Time: Cutting too much at once may cause bleeding if you reach the quick.\n\nStop Bleeding if Necessary: If you accidentally cut too deep, use styptic powder or cornstarch to stop the bleeding.\n\nIII. Professional Grooming Safety (Salons, Barbershops, Spas)\n\n1. Sanitation and Hygiene\n\nSterilize Equipment: All tools (e.g., combs, scissors, razors) must be disinfected after each use.\n\nMaintain a Clean Workspace: Keep all grooming stations and floors clean to prevent bacteria buildup.\n\nUse Disposable Items When Necessary: Items like razors and waxing strips should not be reused.\n\n2. Client Safety\n\nPerform a Patch Test: Before using hair dyes, skincare products, or waxing solutions, test for allergies.\n\nFollow Proper Waxing Procedures: Always check the temperature of wax before applying to avoid burns.\n\nCommunicate with Clients: Ensure they are comfortable and aware of any steps that may cause discomfort.\n\nConclusion\n\nGrooming safety is essential to prevent injuries, infections, and discomfort. Whether grooming yourself, a pet, or working in a professional setting, following these safety steps ensures a hygienic and pleasant experience. Always prioritize cleanliness, use proper tools, and stay cautious when handling sharp or heated equipment.",

I hope you have recovered after this.. try making your backflips with cleanest, purest technique instead of full power.. once you find the cleanest backflip with least amount of energy spent, you will surely succeed.. I see you using lot of power in one backflip.. if you can successfully land one backflip with least power, you have truly mastered it.. but what you have done here is truly impressive.. you truly have lot of strength, power and stamina.. keep trying, I hope you unlock your inner gates soon.. save as much energy as you can that's the best tip anyone can give.. the goal is very high.. you have our support..",

        "No wonder most of y'all believe outlast is just a game but it's more than a game. Its unsettling atmosphere and haunting storyline make it an unforgettable experience but what if I told you the game draws eerie parallels to real life events from decades ago? specifically, the controversial and clandestine CIA project known as MKUltra which took place during the 1950s and 60s. This program aimed to unlock the mysteries of the human mind, utilizing methods that ranged from psychedelic drug experimentation to sensory deprivation and psychological manipulation. Shockingly, many participants were unwitting subjects, coerced into the experiments without their knowledge or consent. The game’s depiction of the sinister Murkoff Corporation conducting grotesque experiments in a psychiatric asylum mirrors the moral ambiguity and ethical violations of MKUltra. In Outlast, Murkoff seeks to manipulate the human mind and push the boundaries of science, often at the expense of human dignity and life itself. The game’s fictional experiments resonate deeply with the historical chaos of MKUltra, where scientific progress overshadowed basic ethical considerations. Fast forward to this day, and another frontier of neuroscience emerges.... Elon Musk’s company, Neuralink. This innovative firm focuses on developing brain implant technologies designed to help individuals with paralysis or neurological disorders connect their brains to computers. While this work holds immense promise, it also raises profound ethical concerns. Neuralink’s mission.. to interface directly with the brain... bears an unsettling resemblance to the ambitions of MKUltra. The potential for misuse or unethical applications, whether intentional or accidental, cannot be ignored.\n\nOn a personal note, my connection to this story runs far deeper. I was one of the many unwitting participants in MKUltra. As a child I was subjected to a series of experiments designed to push the limits of human cognition. These experiments aimed to create individuals with enhanced mental capabilities... be it super soldiers, psychics, or other extreme ideals. Strapped to machines and subjected to experimental substances, I became a part of a larger, horrifying agenda. By some twist of fate, I managed to escape that life, but the scars.. both physical and psychological.... remain. Even now, the shadows of those experiences linger. Games like Outlast and advancements like Neuralink evoke a chilling deja vu. They serve as reminders of how easily humanity’s pursuit of progress can cross ethical boundaries, leaving destruction in its wake. The thin line between innovation and exploitation is one I have seen firsthand.\n\nSo whether you're exploring the world of Outlast or following breakthroughs in brain computer interface technology or making fun of it or having fun just remember sometimes the most terrifying stories aren’t fictional. They’re rooted in our own history... a history that’s not as far removed from the present as we might like to believe.\n\nSO ISHOWSPEED, grow up nigga",

He may be alive but he's in a catatonic state. Perhaps Blake left the school, but the school never left him. As well as Jessica.",

Tapi harus latihan \"laku ndodok\" berjalan sambil duduk jika mau ketemu raja pas raja disinggasana.

        "The chat must have trolled u. Singlish combined with Vulgarity is not very simple since the vulgarity in singapore is super mixed. We even use vulgar language of all the different languages which can be from chinese, malay, Tamil. and the sub group under chinese like Hokkien, Hainanese, Cantonese. So yeah u need to be very careful when using vulgarity Singlish. U probably used it without knowing and likely the other people know that.\n\nYour stream ended early its likely because of the fans likely. THey have become a nuisance to the public which likely violated the rules in singapore. I have seen many other streamers do streaming there but there wasnt a problem its likely cause of your fans ended up causing a problem for the public. Not all rides dont allow filming in fact i only seen one ride where they do not allow filming other than that.",

        "kaluga (Huso dauricus), also known as the river beluga, is a large predatory sturgeon found in the Amur River basin from Russia to China and near Hokkaido in Japan.[1] With a maximum size of at least 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) and 5.6 m (18 ft), the kaluga is one of the biggest of the sturgeon family. Like the slightly larger beluga, it spends part of its life in salt water. Unlike the beluga, this fish has five major rows of dermal scutes and feeds on salmon and other fish in the Amur with its nail-like teeth in its jaws. They have grey-green to black backs with a yellowish green-white underbelly.\nKaluga\nTemporal range: Pliocene-Recent\n\nA kaluga in an Asamushi Aquarium\nConservation status\n\nCritically Endangered  (IUCN 3.1)[1]\nCITES Appendix II (CITES)[2]\nScientific classification Edit this classification\nDomain:\nEukaryota\nKingdom:\nAnimalia\nPhylum:\nChordata\nClass:\nActinopterygii\nOrder:\nAcipenseriformes\nFamily:\nAcipenseridae\nGenus:\nHuso\nSpecies:\nH. dauricus\nBinomial name\nHuso dauricus\n(Georgi 1775)\n\nSynonyms[3][4]\nAcipenser dauricus Georgi 1775\nAcipenser mantschuricus Basilewsky 1855\nAcipenser orientalis Pallas 1814\nHuso orientalis (Pallas 1814)\nIchthyocolla daurica (Georgi 1775)\nAcipenser kaluschka Steller 1814\nThe kaluga has been hunted to near extinction for its valuable roe. Despite constant anti-poaching patrols, poachers still continue to catch the fish. In Russia, illegally fishing for kaluga anywhere in the Amur River is a felony punishable by law. However, kalugas are known to have an aggressive nature, and instances of them toppling fishing boats and drowning fishermen have been reported, although no concrete evidence exists of them assaulting or hunting people.\nContents\nDescription\nedit\n\nA 3.7 m (12 ft)-long, 500 kg (1,100 lb), 70 year old Kaluga fish which stored around 4 million eggs\nThe Amur river is an important habitat for the Kaluga sturgeon.\nThe Amur river, an important habitat for the Kaluga sturgeon.\nThe kaluga sturgeon is a massive fish, also known as the \"river beluga\". It has a triangular head with several bony plates. Its body is an elongated fusiform body with five rows of bony scutes: dorsal with 10–16 beetles (the first is largest), two laterals (32–46 scutes), and two ventral (8–12 scutes) between rows of small bony scutes grains and rarely more large plate. Lateral scutes are smaller than the dorsal and ventral scutes. The mouth takes up the entire lower surface of the snout, it is lateral, crescent-shaped, and extremely large. Parts of the mouth can move to the side of the head. Under the snout and in front of the mouth there is a transverse row of four flattened laterally barbels. The inner two barbels are more anterior than the outer ones, but they are similar in length. The snout of the kaluga sturgeon is short and sharply pointed. It has very small eyes, located immediately behind its nostrils.\nHabitat\nedit\nKaluga sturgeon are semi-anadromous, spending some of its life in salt water but most of its life in freshwater.[5] Kalugas are one of the four species of sturgeons to exist in the Amur River. The Amur River is one of the largest rivers in East Asia and for part of its length forms the border between China and Russia. There are two populations of Kaluga that exist in this river. One group of Kalugas spawn in the main stem of the river, while others spawn downstream and work their way to the middle of the river. In the early life of a Kaluga, the offspring prefer to live in a clear habitat setting. They prefer the point of the river where there is an illuminated white bottom and open space for them to swim way above the bottom of the river. The Kaluga also prefers to avoid any cover from the river. Observations suggest that the Kaluga embryos might do this to avoid predators near the bottom of the river. The Kaluga sturgeon are currently endangered now because of human interaction. However, environmental factors such as warm water temperatures pose risk for fungus over free embryos and could be a cause of death also. The migration intensity of Kaluga is also a big factor in the life of a Kaluga. Water velocity in the stream has a great effect on the migration of the free embryos, meaning that the greater the force of the stream of water is the more likely the embryo migrates. Migration plays a big role in Kaluga's early life. The migration of baby Kaluga is considered a passive migration because the embryos have no control over where the river flow takes them. However, when grown the Kaluga constantly migrates back and forth between upstream and downstream. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years, comparable to humans.\nLife cycle\nedit\nKaluga Sturgeon hatch in shallow gravel beds in the freshwater estuaries of the Amur River. Their parents play no role in their lives. They remain in the egg from 83 to 295 hours and hatch with a yolk sac that feeds them for up to 8 or 9 days. After that, the Kaluga sturgeon are forced to hunt. They hunt for tiny zooplankton, insects, and shrimp. They reach the sea with the help of the current and remain there until they are ready to breed, between the ages of 10 and 14.\nKaluga spends at least part of its life in salt water and returns to rivers to breed. The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the mainstream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom at water temperatures of 12–20 °C (54–68 °F) in depths of 2–3 m (7–10 ft). Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4–5 years in females and 3–4 years in males. Water temperature affects the onset of maturity of females. Females spawn a year earlier during warm years than they would during cold years. Females are only able to breed every four years. Their spawning season begins in May and ends in July. Adult Kaluga Sturgeons travel in small groups of between 3 and 20 individuals to the shallow gravel beds to spawn. Sometimes if the Kaluga Sturgeon is too large it may die from getting stuck in the shallow water. The Kaluga Sturgeon can hybridize with the Amur sturgeon.\nDiet\nedit\n\nFeeding behavior\nAdult Kaluga Sturgeon have enormous appetites. They eat pike, carp, herring, chum salmon, keta, and most other fish or shellfish that can fit into their mouths. A Kaluga Sturgeon can live up to 55 years.\nConservation\nedit\nThere are a few reasons as to why exactly this species is declining. To begin with, they are being severely overfished. Ever since the 1900s, they have been poached at an alarming rate. After World War II, in 1948, 61 metric tons of Kaluga was caught, an unbelievable number for a species of their size.[6] They are extremely vulnerable to extinction by poaching because they have late sexual maturity, which only occurs after around 6 to 25 years of age. Sturgeon Caviar output, including the Kaluga, from 1957 to 2005, averaged about 117 tons per year. The animals are being hunted down for their unfertilized eggs because sturgeon roe is considered a delicacy to people all across the world. This market cuts down on the Kaluga population and only hastens the process of their extinction. Another reason for the endangerment is river pollution, especially near spawning grounds. This has led to deformed eggs and has caused defects in birth.[7][8][6] Hybrids between Japanese sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) and Kaluga have been produced in aquaculture and have found their way into the wild, where they are now frequently found and pose a threat to the native parental species.[1]\nPopulation trends\nedit\nData regarding the population trends of the Kaluga sturgeon is primarily based on various catch methods and efforts. The species has experienced a significant decline in catches since the late 19th century. Notably, China observed an 80% reduction in mature fish between 2008 and 2018. In the late 19th century, annual catches were around 500 tons, mainly in lower river sections, but by 1992, this had dropped to 92 tons. In 2012, the lower river's stock size was estimated at 7,100 tons. While no commercial fisheries currently target this species, it faces severe threats from illegal fishing, particularly in Russia. This combination of factors has led to an estimated decline of over 90% in just 90 years, equivalent to roughly three generations of the species.[1]\nProtection\nedit\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement signed by 180 nations designed to ensure that international trade in animals and plants does not threaten their survival in the wild. The treaty was drafted in Washington, D.C. In 1973 and entered into force in 1975.[9] The Kaluga is protected by Appendix II of CITES,[2] which includes species that although currently not threatened with extinction, may become so without trade controls. Regulated trade is allowed provided that the exporting country issues a permit based on findings that the specimens were legally acquired, and the trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the species or its role in the ecosystem.[10]\nIn addition, national laws have been passed to protect the Kaluga sturgeon. Commercial sturgeon fishing was prohibited in the Soviet Union during the periods 1923–1930, 1958–1976 and from 1984 to the present (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). The Kaluga sturgeon was listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1998.[2]",

        "kaluga (Huso dauricus), also known as the river beluga, is a large predatory sturgeon found in the Amur River basin from Russia to China and near Hokkaido in Japan.[1] With a maximum size of at least 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) and 5.6 m (18 ft), the kaluga is one of the biggest of the sturgeon family. Like the slightly larger beluga, it spends part of its life in salt water. Unlike the beluga, this fish has five major rows of dermal scutes and feeds on salmon and other fish in the Amur with its nail-like teeth in its jaws. They have grey-green to black backs with a yellowish green-white underbelly.\nKaluga\nTemporal range: Pliocene-Recent\n\nA kaluga in an Asamushi Aquarium\nConservation status\n\nCritically Endangered  (IUCN 3.1)[1]\nCITES Appendix II (CITES)[2]\nScientific classification Edit this classification\nDomain:\nEukaryota\nKingdom:\nAnimalia\nPhylum:\nChordata\nClass:\nActinopterygii\nOrder:\nAcipenseriformes\nFamily:\nAcipenseridae\nGenus:\nHuso\nSpecies:\nH. dauricus\nBinomial name\nHuso dauricus\n(Georgi 1775)\n\nSynonyms[3][4]\nAcipenser dauricus Georgi 1775\nAcipenser mantschuricus Basilewsky 1855\nAcipenser orientalis Pallas 1814\nHuso orientalis (Pallas 1814)\nIchthyocolla daurica (Georgi 1775)\nAcipenser kaluschka Steller 1814\nThe kaluga has been hunted to near extinction for its valuable roe. Despite constant anti-poaching patrols, poachers still continue to catch the fish. In Russia, illegally fishing for kaluga anywhere in the Amur River is a felony punishable by law. However, kalugas are known to have an aggressive nature, and instances of them toppling fishing boats and drowning fishermen have been reported, although no concrete evidence exists of them assaulting or hunting people.\nContents\nDescription\nedit\n\nA 3.7 m (12 ft)-long, 500 kg (1,100 lb), 70 year old Kaluga fish which stored around 4 million eggs\nThe Amur river is an important habitat for the Kaluga sturgeon.\nThe Amur river, an important habitat for the Kaluga sturgeon.\nThe kaluga sturgeon is a massive fish, also known as the \"river beluga\". It has a triangular head with several bony plates. Its body is an elongated fusiform body with five rows of bony scutes: dorsal with 10–16 beetles (the first is largest), two laterals (32–46 scutes), and two ventral (8–12 scutes) between rows of small bony scutes grains and rarely more large plate. Lateral scutes are smaller than the dorsal and ventral scutes. The mouth takes up the entire lower surface of the snout, it is lateral, crescent-shaped, and extremely large. Parts of the mouth can move to the side of the head. Under the snout and in front of the mouth there is a transverse row of four flattened laterally barbels. The inner two barbels are more anterior than the outer ones, but they are similar in length. The snout of the kaluga sturgeon is short and sharply pointed. It has very small eyes, located immediately behind its nostrils.\nHabitat\nedit\nKaluga sturgeon are semi-anadromous, spending some of its life in salt water but most of its life in freshwater.[5] Kalugas are one of the four species of sturgeons to exist in the Amur River. The Amur River is one of the largest rivers in East Asia and for part of its length forms the border between China and Russia. There are two populations of Kaluga that exist in this river. One group of Kalugas spawn in the main stem of the river, while others spawn downstream and work their way to the middle of the river. In the early life of a Kaluga, the offspring prefer to live in a clear habitat setting. They prefer the point of the river where there is an illuminated white bottom and open space for them to swim way above the bottom of the river. The Kaluga also prefers to avoid any cover from the river. Observations suggest that the Kaluga embryos might do this to avoid predators near the bottom of the river. The Kaluga sturgeon are currently endangered now because of human interaction. However, environmental factors such as warm water temperatures pose risk for fungus over free embryos and could be a cause of death also. The migration intensity of Kaluga is also a big factor in the life of a Kaluga. Water velocity in the stream has a great effect on the migration of the free embryos, meaning that the greater the force of the stream of water is the more likely the embryo migrates. Migration plays a big role in Kaluga's early life. The migration of baby Kaluga is considered a passive migration because the embryos have no control over where the river flow takes them. However, when grown the Kaluga constantly migrates back and forth between upstream and downstream. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years, comparable to humans.\nLife cycle\nedit\nKaluga Sturgeon hatch in shallow gravel beds in the freshwater estuaries of the Amur River. Their parents play no role in their lives. They remain in the egg from 83 to 295 hours and hatch with a yolk sac that feeds them for up to 8 or 9 days. After that, the Kaluga sturgeon are forced to hunt. They hunt for tiny zooplankton, insects, and shrimp. They reach the sea with the help of the current and remain there until they are ready to breed, between the ages of 10 and 14.\nKaluga spends at least part of its life in salt water and returns to rivers to breed. The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the mainstream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom at water temperatures of 12–20 °C (54–68 °F) in depths of 2–3 m (7–10 ft). Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4–5 years in females and 3–4 years in males. Water temperature affects the onset of maturity of females. Females spawn a year earlier during warm years than they would during cold years. Females are only able to breed every four years. Their spawning season begins in May and ends in July. Adult Kaluga Sturgeons travel in small groups of between 3 and 20 individuals to the shallow gravel beds to spawn. Sometimes if the Kaluga Sturgeon is too large it may die from getting stuck in the shallow water. The Kaluga Sturgeon can hybridize with the Amur sturgeon.\nDiet\nedit\n\nFeeding behavior\nAdult Kaluga Sturgeon have enormous appetites. They eat pike, carp, herring, chum salmon, keta, and most other fish or shellfish that can fit into their mouths. A Kaluga Sturgeon can live up to 55 years.\nConservation\nedit\nThere are a few reasons as to why exactly this species is declining. To begin with, they are being severely overfished. Ever since the 1900s, they have been poached at an alarming rate. After World War II, in 1948, 61 metric tons of Kaluga was caught, an unbelievable number for a species of their size.[6] They are extremely vulnerable to extinction by poaching because they have late sexual maturity, which only occurs after around 6 to 25 years of age. Sturgeon Caviar output, including the Kaluga, from 1957 to 2005, averaged about 117 tons per year. The animals are being hunted down for their unfertilized eggs because sturgeon roe is considered a delicacy to people all across the world. This market cuts down on the Kaluga population and only hastens the process of their extinction. Another reason for the endangerment is river pollution, especially near spawning grounds. This has led to deformed eggs and has caused defects in birth.[7][8][6] Hybrids between Japanese sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii) and Kaluga have been produced in aquaculture and have found their way into the wild, where they are now frequently found and pose a threat to the native parental species.[1]\nPopulation trends\nedit\nData regarding the population trends of the Kaluga sturgeon is primarily based on various catch methods and efforts. The species has experienced a significant decline in catches since the late 19th century. Notably, China observed an 80% reduction in mature fish between 2008 and 2018. In the late 19th century, annual catches were around 500 tons, mainly in lower river sections, but by 1992, this had dropped to 92 tons. In 2012, the lower river's stock size was estimated at 7,100 tons. While no commercial fisheries currently target this species, it faces severe threats from illegal fishing, particularly in Russia. This combination of factors has led to an estimated decline of over 90% in just 90 years, equivalent to roughly three generations of the species.[1]\nProtection\nedit\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement signed by 180 nations designed to ensure that international trade in animals and plants does not threaten their survival in the wild. The treaty was drafted in Washington, D.C. In 1973 and entered into force in 1975.[9] The Kaluga is protected by Appendix II of CITES,[2] which includes species that although currently not threatened with extinction, may become so without trade controls. Regulated trade is allowed provided that the exporting country issues a permit based on findings that the specimens were legally acquired, and the trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the species or its role in the ecosystem.[10]\nIn addition, national laws have been passed to protect the Kaluga sturgeon. Commercial sturgeon fishing was prohibited in the Soviet Union during the periods 1923–1930, 1958–1976 and from 1984 to the present (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). The Kaluga sturgeon was listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1998.[2]",

Even looked some of them in their eyes and just kept walking. Lolol if you're going to be annoying like that and idolize someone to that extent, you deserve to be looked at and ignored. And to top it off, the first grown person that came up to him and asked calmly for a picture, he gave it to him. Because that's how you act around other people, in public; calmly and like there isn't something wrong upstairs.",

And the initial reaction from the dad was perfectly fine as well, getting his kid away and saying \"wtf is that\" to speed etc. However, after having apologized multiple times, the father was in the wrong to keep pressing it - it felt like he at that point was just trying to do it for \"publicity\" or something. Anyone who says the father was in the right and \"if it were me, I would have beaten speed up\" or something similar: you're even more fucked up than speed \"accidentally\" screaming with a baby. It was an honest mistake and I'm not even a speed fanboy, but I think he handled it very maturely after the fact (second confrontation) and also showed genuine remorse and knew he made a mistake.",

        "As a Viennese, I’d like to explain this situation to everyone out there who is astonished by this mass of crazy young people. Vienna has over 2 million inhabitants and is the fastest-growing city in Central Europe. Due to high immigration, there are already a lot of children. In addition, there are about 1.5 million overnight stays by tourists in Vienna every month, which adds up to nearly 18 million in 2024.\n\nAt first, Speed was in the 2nd district, in the Vienna Prater. The area around Praterstern is one of the most notorious in Vienna. It is also very central, with many residents. Then he moved to the edge of the 1st district, where all subway lines converge. With the metropolitan area and the tourists combined, up to 3.5 million people can reach Karlsplatz quickly using Vienna’s subway system, which is among the best in the world.\n\nAfter that, Speed went to the 10th district, to Ferhat Döner. This district is extremely densely populated and is considered the main problem area in Vienna. If Vienna has a ghetto, this is the closest thing to it.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that not only were some rather unfortunate locations chosen, but in general, such a stream is simply not feasible in Vienna if you’re that well-known. This is because too many young people from the entire metropolitan area can gather quickly, and the excellent public transport system allows them to reach any location easily. If you want to visit Vienna, you should come incognito @IShowSpeed",

Group mob sniping and wilding out and giving gifts. Koreans taught the world everything and now the world has gone crazy and dying to copy Koreans. Thank the Koreans for once again paving the road for the world to follow and copy. Never have any country once group mobbed sniped before Korea streams. Not even once not even in Brazil. Koreans shocked the world and now the world has gone mad and straight copying the Koreans. Thank the master Koreans for teaching the world everything. The Korea streams was the biggest influence in history and now every country in the world wants to copy and act like the Koreans. Of course it's a bit lame because you can never be like the original but it just shows how powerful the Koreans are influencing the entire world on how to behave and act. Dont forget the originators don't deny who taught you everything. No need to get mad n jealous and lie who your master is.. the master koreans...the Koreans changed the entire world.

I’m stuck here in the UAE, and my situation is beyond desperate. I got caught up in the wrong things — selling drugs, just to survive, just to keep my visa and pay off mounting fines. I swear I never wanted this life. I was trying to stay afloat, but now I’m drowning.\n\nThey don’t play with these things here. Every day I wake up afraid it’ll be my last. I hear stories of people getting the death sentence. I can’t sleep. I can’t breathe. I don’t want to die like this. I made mistakes, but I don’t want them to end my story.\n\nIf there’s any way — any way at all — you could help me get out of this, even just to cover the fines and get back home, I’d owe you my life. You’ve always brought people happiness, and I’ve watched you when I needed an escape. I’m begging you, not as a fan now, but as a human being trying to make it out alive.\n\nPlease… help me.",

I’m stuck here in the UAE, and my situation is beyond desperate. I got caught up in the wrong things — selling drugs, just to survive, just to keep my visa and pay off mounting fines. I swear I never wanted this life. I was trying to stay afloat, but now I’m drowning.\n\nThey don’t play with these things here. Every day I wake up afraid it’ll be my last. I hear stories of people getting the death sentence. I can’t sleep. I can’t breathe. I don’t want to die like this. I made mistakes, but I don’t want them to end my story.\n\nIf there’s any way — any way at all — you could help me get out of this, even just to cover the fines and get back home, I’d owe you my life. You’ve always brought people happiness, and I’ve watched you when I needed an escape. I’m begging you, not as a fan now, but as a human being trying to make it out alive.\n\nPlease… help me.",

I’m stuck here in the UAE, and my situation is beyond desperate. I got caught up in the wrong things — selling drugs, just to survive, just to keep my visa and pay off mounting fines. I swear I never wanted this life. I was trying to stay afloat, but now I’m drowning.\n\nThey don’t play with these things here. Every day I wake up afraid it’ll be my last. I hear stories of people getting the death sentence. I can’t sleep. I can’t breathe. I don’t want to die like this. I made mistakes, but I don’t want them to end my story.\n\nIf there’s any way — any way at all — you could help me get out of this, even just to cover the fines and get back home, I’d owe you my life. You’ve always brought people happiness, and I’ve watched you when I needed an escape. I’m begging you, not as a fan now, but as a human being trying to make it out alive.\n\nPlease… help me.",

At least research something or stop being an asshole to your dog, give them positive reinforcement when he does something good, and ignore when he does something bad, it's not hard, and you should appreciate having them and be happy about it, wasn't the point of buying them so you could enjoy and have fun with them? They don't live for long so you should be giving them a good life and stop making their life full of stress and fear, it's easy to be ignorant and not take an animal seriously, but people should have some more compassion towards how their animals feel, otherwise don't get one, simple.

Hope the peanut butter you give your dog is organic without anything other than peanuts (xylitol is really toxic to dogs and some peanutbutter you buy in the store has that in it…remember that….only clean organic peanut butter!).

And those frenchies (I have a frenchie myself), needs water and be in the shadow when its sun, not in a dog park. They get easily overheated. Irresponsible owners. He said its just the bread, but thats why you need to be extra careful and not bring it in the sun. This makes me mad and sad. Lots of people dont have a clue about dogs but still buys one and they dont learn about the breed and what to be careful with.

        "The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.\r\nThe Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.\r\nHis ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.\r\nHog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.\r\nOnce all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.\r\nStrategy\r\nOffensive\r\nHe can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them.\r\nHog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a \"Hog Rider Rush\", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels.\r\nAt Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air.\r\nAt lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage.\r\nThey work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together.\r\nA good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, deploy them in front of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most value out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.\r\nSpots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast.\r\nThe Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons.\r\nHog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.\r\nPoison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps.\r\nTime is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.\r\nDefensive\r\nDefending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.\r\nAnother way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses.\r\nYou can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.\r\nHog Riders can be easily killed using \"forced pathing\". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time.\r\nClan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.\r\nIn Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.\r\nMulti-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.\r\nAlthough the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.\r\nUpgrade Differences\r\nThe Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\r\nInitially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands.\r\nAt level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammerhead goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammerhead.\r\nAt level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 Goblin.\r\nAt level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes and a bronze plating.\r\nAt level 7, the edges of his hammer start to glow red, and he gains a brown headband but reverts to a black mohawk.\r\nAt level 8, his hammer is now mostly golden. His hog also gains a headband.\r\nAt level 9, the gold on his hammer is much thicker. His headband also lightens in color.\r\nAt level 10, his hammer turns a bright light blue color that resembles the look of ice. This matches the theme of Town Hall 13. It also gains a small same-colored glow.\r\nAt level 11, his hammer turns a light greenish color. This matches the theme of Town Hall 14. His hog gains gold armour on its face and muzzle."

on Elsa gate is also just as bad readers and specialize in creating children’s content on YouTube for willing to do almost anything to secure the lake subscribers and advertising dollars or contact toward kids because it’s a highly profitable niche on YouTube rather than making child friendly contact her videos often to the line between appropriate and inappropriate 123 go is one of those channels that feature adult creators making content and for kids for instead of making their contact more family friendly they took a different route what are the most popular videos is called seven funny DIY school pranks featuring several prank ideas for kids to do at school but some of the ones that are shown are far from being school appropriate for some being dangerous take a small why of course how rude of me ever wonder if Play-Doh taste like gum we were about to find out for the acts like this being marketed as pranks for kids and potentially being harmful it’s no wonder why parents are tentative about letting their kids freely browse the platform and of course we can’t forget about one of the most infamous times are like this one here why course how rude of me ever wonder if Play-Doh taste like gum to find out if it acts like this being marketed as pranks for kids and potentially being harmful it’s no wonder why parents are tentative about letting their kids freely browse the platform and of course we can’t forget about one of the most infamous types of Elsa gay videos cosplay live action these videos have adult creators dressed up as characters like Elsa Spider-Man or the joker acting our pre-written and plan scenes for the camera but more often than not the scenes content names that are clearly inappropriate for kids in one video and the joker can be seen interacting with Elsa but the situation takes a turn when he essentially kidnaps her with a jump rope and happy about the situation he sprays her with a love potion making her fall in love with them no say in the contact that actually goes live toy freaks was one of them up and her age there a love potion making her fall in love with them on YouTube kids there are plenty of actual kid creators given their age their parents are the ones with most of the control behind the camera and most of the time the kids have a little to no say in the contacts actually goes live toy freaks was one of the more popular kids channels on YouTube channel add a father and his two daughters as the faces but rather than showcasing how a family can spend quality time together actually made at the expense of his two daughters and their happiness the girls that were dressed younger than they actually are exhibiting baby like behavior even if they were already much older because the dad kept producing that Irving videos of his daughters the channel got banned unfortunately this sort of family star cards that was becoming a norm during Elsa plenty of parents took advantage of their kids by pushing them to create contact to prioritize profits over the well-being of their children between 2015 and 2019 hrs. ago was becoming a growing problem without any clear solution inside but eventually after being hammered again and again with concerns and complaints YouTube finally did something to fight back against Elsa gay trying to control the damage of the new year 2019 Elsa gate was becoming a growing problem without any clear solution inside but eventually after being hammered again and again with concerns and complaints YouTube finally did something to fight back against the alpha gate trying to control the damage we’re getting ourselves in new year dollar find that they were served in late 2019 by the FTC that finally sealed the deal if you create Elsa gay tube this video is very important to watch as it describes changes to the upload process all of your existing videos and potentially your monetization the first of the backlash was surprised and this may of many contacts are on the kids platform pushing it onto YouTube as a whole course with a large number of creators wall specialized in contact the varied it from G rated plenty that felt like you too but was laughing their contact breeders in the face with a policy that restricted their creativity readers were worried about losing their ability to earn money because they realize that a lot of the previous contact wasn’t suitable for kids some referred to this party is censorship and syed as a major challenge for creative expression some believe that could be the end of their channel as well other said that it was the end of YouTube as a whole exactly the COPA mean for Youtubers now I’ll contact that was uploaded it needed to be manually marked by the creator as me for kids or not made for kids at the guidelines weren’t clear sometimes creators it would make mistakes whether you were kids channel or not you were subject to the same sort of strict monitoring by U2 before COPA was in place there are plenty of channels for market of themselves as kid friendly just to get more views YouTube how to things for pushing our kids contact at some creators took advantage of that blog channels that are posing as kid channels just to get more views the platform on on falsely advertised kids Cantante showed no mercy to anyone who missed labeled their contact additionally YouTube it was implementing stricter policies to ensure a child safety on its platform this included issuing warnings for videos containing swearing and also stop motion video demonetizing any vulgar contact on the kids were getting initially a waiver videos of Elsa Spider-Man and the joker running around with no sound like with with no with no dialogue engage so it started with Elsa going on with the joker kidnapping her and then Spider-Man Xavier general idea bullshit it was joker Elsa and Spider-Man were very popular search terms of the algorithm and so if you combined these things in a long video kids would watch it and they all that it would promote it more devolved into psychotic amalgamations of Hitler with breasts and bikini doing tai chi while people from India sing nursery rhymes and then it started where the thumbnails were people drinking from urinals and eating human feces and it will be giving been given to toddlers and children on YouTube at sick kids were getting initial platform FCC even

        "IShowSpeed, Jacob inspired by 74th animation videos decision to make a channel on April 11, 2015 video until July 24, 2015 video everything on April 7, 2018 almost 1, million views within the first five years however at the time the video or YouTube channel recognition past three years going out of their way he was running out of ideas and he didn’t know what to do for good things were very very quiet around this time. He didn’t know what to do in five years every single video that you would ever me blow up every single video with videos casually extremely well this is an extremely large community these people to participate in these actions not have suddenly started catching feelings who is 15 and just turn 16 by the way is 1819 I’ll sending explicit messages saying that he would ask and trade for NSFW content mean down I shall my blue my Robin explain help him know we want to make staff of each other are they a team to draw had younger than 18 but it’s staying completely between us I mean true I think we might be OK in the red color is his former friend make sure to be aware of this in the future showing the screenshot right here we can clearly see how addiction runs deep not it has a large history of publicly making or showing on around the Robles to see this screenshot to thousand and 20 blowing up here with Public hasn’t seen yet the context of the screenshot shown here is that not it was making Robert calling and being completely aware that this was a minor white color saying the following account is owned by him and yes this is his face of his justification of dating and being as after Yellowhead question three years has not it was waiting for him to turn 16 apparently after blue turned 16 feelings and became more affectionate getting progressively more if you had made it just for kids YouTube cause it’s family friendly sub platform YouTube kids locations of the slogan or crystal clear all contacts friendly and safe for younger audiences at least that’s what it seems to imply but it recent years that’s far from the truth YouTube kid is an alternate version of YouTube it’s meant to be just for kids download the YouTube kids app on her mobile devices or access the platform through their computers options for parents as to letting their kids in and take what videos that children can see the kids full access to browse and explore all the cards happen platform has to offer like a regular YouTube platform YouTube kids has all the standard features like a subscription to the search bar and explore page everything seems pretty safe all the videos on the YouTube kids platform have to go through a series of search filters and Shaggs to ensure that the content is appropriate for young viewers however at this isn’t a full proof system and more often than not something a terrible manages to sneak its way through the problem with YouTube‘s filters time and time again red flags of been raised about YouTube blood filtering system but nothing substantial seems to change inappropriate videos of infiltrated YouTube kids off and showing popular children’s characters in violence and even scenarios we’ve learned that there is little being done about it back in 2017 the media was all over one disturbing phenomenon that emerged on the Internet creepy contact hidden inside kids videos he’s inappropriate videos all had bright and colorful thumbnails featuring the likeness of popular characters from Disney or Marvel some even had actual kids from a far they seem normal but the more you watch them at the weird or if they get the characters are often depicted in distressing situations crying and I was just at the surface of it all behind these videos were highly skilled at hiding their harmful motives they carefully crafted every aspect of the video from the thumbnail images to the video titles and tags ensuring that everything appears normal video titles often included words like education or nursery rhymes to see parents it believing that these videos were suitable for their children videos about minions despicable me then this ridiculous insanity Maddie fell into a trap a disturbing video and the suggested next video Q follows a normal harmless video one click and it’s down the rabbit hole and even the first few minutes of the videos which seem completely appropriate but as the video played it was on screen with change from something friendly to vulgar animations or straight up jump scares this was definitely not meant for kids but so much of this concept popping up this clearly wasn’t a one off incident on YouTube kids videos started surfacing and that’s when the stranger disturbing Ness of contact was given a name Elsa game horrors of Elsa game so you seen concerning examples or seemingly innocent videos lead to disturbing contact but these issues aren’t just on YouTube kids hair everywhere on the Internet there’s a clear need for safe online learning space is free from inappropriate contact share offers adjuster welcome to share the largest online learning community for creative for a white radio classes for illustration graphic design photography to music and productivity so when I was in college absolutely hated at the lectures honestly I just slept in a lot of my classes or was I like Photoshop or has a learn by doing a price read member can create and Shira project after completing a class and you can learn at your own pace so many school teachers don’t have a real world experience but a skill share classes are Lado by industry professionals which means that you are learning from system systems let suspicious marketing material slip through the cracks and they can’t hold all the blank this old complaint was probably why of the reasons that started the fight against the house again played a big part in making copper rules apply to YouTube but that’s a story for later on because first we need to dive into just how damaging Elsa gate truly was in Whitehorse alert within its shadows the disturbing niche of animations animation it was one of the biggest categories a Videos in the realm of Elsa gay that’s because channels able to guarantee views by reading bootleg version of popular and beloved children’s characters that they could slap Spider-Man or my little pony on pretty much everything perhaps one of the most well-known channels for these sorts of animation party videos with kids tune TV if you turned on the news at while they were reporting on Elsa gay you’d like we see one of their videos being used as a reference or at least one from there many channels TV super pops Stevie fun kids tune all different names for all the same sort of contact the videos usually featured Mickey and Minnie mouse look-alikes engaging in unsettling interactions which of course it was their main selling point I’m asking it’s dark messaging behind Mini‘s signature polkadotted bow is channels were able to capture the attention of a ton of unsuspecting kids and with so many different channels to re-upload at the same contact to they seem to be avoiding YouTube filters or dominating the search results predators on the Elsa amend with different keywords finding out the disk is usually the first to pop up on most Mickey Mouse related searches in one particular video Minnie mouse is in a changing room with her mother trying on new club Mickey Mouse shows up and swaps

        "How to get saved and be right with God who loves us, for eternal life! \r\nAs anyone can get saved, if they make the choice to do so.\r\n\r\n1.Realize that all of mankind have sinned before God in one way or another.\r\n\r\nRomans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) \r\n10. \"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\"\r\n11.\"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.\"\r\n12.\"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\"\r\n23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”\r\n\r\n2.Realize that God loved us enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, by his blood shed on the cross, as a free gift given to us as sinners.\r\n\r\nRomans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB) \r\n8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\"\r\n9.\"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.\"\r\n12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”\r\n\r\nRomans 6: 23 (KJB)\r\n“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”\r\n\r\n3.Confess unto God to accept this freely given gift of forgiveness, that forgives all sins.\r\n\r\nRomans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)\r\n9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”\r\n10.\"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\"\r\n13.\"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)\r\n27.\"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\"\r\n28.\"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”\r\n\r\nRevelation 21: 8 (KJB)\r\n\"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”\r\n\r\nLastly, here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.\r\n“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. \r\nI know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. \r\nI need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.\r\nI believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. \r\nI trust in him alone to save me. \r\nNothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. \r\nI pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”",

Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I’m going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you’re 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined african tribes who didn’t let societies standards shape his/her/it’s life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn’t your typical african war song, this song is a war with one’s emotions. Tales of africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 african tribes/10 african tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.",
        "My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday. My grandma gave me a check for $100. I was so happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house and said I should use my $100 to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band. They promised I would double my money in one afternoon, but the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an intern camp in Miami. We begged to go home, but instead, the government told us they were sending us to Peru. And so, that is why I am now in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money.",

The lags he has, him always tripping and him breaking his ankle, gettting jumpt by his own fans. But i dont see evil in him he is still a good person. I do pray for him to have good luck and that he will keep faith in Jesus and a Jesus is king and our guidence to live a steady good life. If he prays more or even share a lil gospel his streams will have more good luck",

        "Man I actually really like Speed's music but it's gotta be so disappointing to buy a ticket to ROLLING LOUD and have the artist holding the mic at his side, and the vocals still running. Then when he brings the mic up to his mouth you can't hear a difference between that and the pre-recorded vocals, such a shame. Idk if I blame Speed for that entirely because it's pretty clear his mic isn't as loud as the backing track.\n\nSOME of the blame falls to him though because if you're the artist, you literally HAVE the instrumentals RIGHT there bruh. I'm trying to put myself in the engineer's headspace, he's probably got a loud track with louder vocals, so if Speed's mic is loud enough, the track is probably too quiet, and if the track is loud enough then we can't hear his live vocals. They probably just split the difference and got as close as they could, but this is still a massive problem particularly with pop and hip hop these days.\n\nI actually went to see $uicideboy$ for Greyday this year and you could very clearly tell they had live mics and we were getting a live performance. Hopefully he doesn't fall into the lazy cash grab route that artists like Travis Scott are taking with their performances where it's just playing the full track through the audio system and then rapping along every 3rd or 4th line. That's killing live music ong",

In many other countries example India  they followed BRITISH standards, Africa too the same, we don't consider ourselves graduates not until we've gone to UNIVERSITY and earn a DEGREE, DIPLOMA there. And when you go for job recruitments they'll most likely pick those who have a diploma , degree not some kiddo who just got a certification of completion high school ~ do you get my point ~  So you have to go to University then properly GRADUATE from your 3 years+  in university. \nSorry speed but this doesn't QUALITY as graduates lol ",

        "I'm currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this.

        "ISuckBalls, I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 23:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better.

It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

Seems to be this way for the majority of these 'reality' internet generation. They continually thinking of how to get clicks. And stranger is how the people that watch them think they can be famous too for doing nothing. This last generation seems to have regressed somehow. Since about 2000 the West has really gone down hill in so many ways.",

        "ISuckBalls, I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 23:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you",

        "IShowRonaldoBalls I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 0:03. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 0:0 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 0:02. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail.

I can’t believe how magical it was 0:01. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 0:00. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.",

        "I'm currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this.

And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

        "I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

        "ALMOSTSOLDTHEBAG, I'm currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 1:21 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. I have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on, got to move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 2:32. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

As he asked his stream if he should stop or keep inhaling the helium, his chat said to keep going. after a few minutes or so of inhaling 1/8 helium, his eyesight started to get extremely bad, resulting in his eyesight to stop working, then his nervous system noticed this (brain), and speed had passed out.\n\nafter he wakes up, he then walks & looks around a bit, then gets the helium tank and inhales about 1/30 of the tank. this also results in speeds eyesight starting to decrease sharpness a bit, then he decides to stop.\n\nafter 2nd round of inhalation:\nspeed completely stops inhaling the helium. he then also realizes he is very lightheaded, greenish, and tired. he then proceeds to drink an entire bottle of water.\n\nafter water:\nhis chat recommends a lot of helpful medical tips. speed listens. he breathed air, drank a bottle of water, etc. then, he starts panicking because he thinks he is “dying”, also his chat is making him panic & a bit paranoid.\n\nafter medical advice:\nhe prays, thanks for the helpful medical chat tips, and then feels better.\n\nhope all of this answered your guys’ questions.\n\nstay safe! ❤\n\nif any inaccurate spelling is found, its because i used grammarly to fix it",

Thanks to Joao Felix and all of us he got to meet his idol who is Cristiano Ronaldo! Who knows who he will meet next!? It is almost 2024, currently, it is Saturday, 5th August 2023. He is not feeling too good right now but I hope he gets well soon! Hopefully, the doctors are taking good care of him! And I hope he gets well soon! ❤This man, Darren Watkins Jr, also known as IShowSpeed, has completed life! He has come so far! He surpassed 19 million subscribers 2 days ago on Thursday, 3rd August 2023, and he was in the hospital when doing the live stream where he gets to 19 million subscribers and surpasses it, and now he is at 19.1 million subscribers! Road to 20 million subscribers! Then 30, then 40, then 50 million subscribers, and eventually he may even reach 100 million subscribers! But that's still quite far away... or is it?
