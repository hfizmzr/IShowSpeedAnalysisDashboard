        "I really enjoyed everything that came out of the AMP house for a while and it made me become a fan. Unfortunately I’m almost 30 and I’ve been watching Kai move recently.  His new fame leads him to think that selflessness (with borderline unlimited money) automatically means positivity. He’s providing selflessness to people that don’t deserve it time and time again and he is not using his power properly as of recent. Speed set his brother up for complete success and Speed’s brother pissed it away immediately. I believe in helping the underdog but they are publicly trying to help people that are borderline refusing help while there are millions of people watching that would KILL for a fraction of the opportunity their inner circle gets. Raikai is going to be the downfall of this group and Speed dragging his “ woe is me” brother into it won’t help anything.",

This gift cannot be earned through good deeds or by simply being \"good\" (Ephesians 2:8; 1 Timothy 1:9). It is a matter of faith (acting out on what you believe according to God's Word concerning salvation). \n\nIf you have come here looking for a change in your life, if you have come seeking a peace that is found only through a personal relationship with a loving God, then you are at the right place. God is ready and willing to help you right now, and right where you are. \n\nPray this prayer: \n\nHeavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, \"Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved\" (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You. I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10. \"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\" I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.          \n\nIf you have prayed this prayer, welcome to the family of God.",

This gift cannot be earned through good deeds or by simply being \"good\" (Ephesians 2:8; 1 Timothy 1:9). It is a matter of faith (acting out on what you believe according to God's Word concerning salvation). \n\nIf you have come here looking for a change in your life, if you have come seeking a peace that is found only through a personal relationship with a loving God, then you are at the right place. God is ready and willing to help you right now, and right where you are. \n\nPray this prayer: \n\nHeavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, \"Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved\" (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You. I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10. \"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\" I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.          \n\nIf you have prayed this prayer, welcome to the family of God.",

For one, watch those tutorials before going to the store so you can take inventory of your pantry first and then get what you’re missing. Wash your chicken with water, white vinegar, and lime… scrub your chicken with lime and use your knife to peal any hard scaly pieces off.. then once you rinse twice, pat your chicken dry with clean papertowel, and make sure all water is out of the bowl, then season… make sure you season your flour… my egg mix is usually with buttermilk… season your wings, toss in egg mix, then coat in seasoned flour.. have your oil warming up and make sure it’s enough to cover the chicken… fry until golden on medium heat.",

Watching a stream or one of his videos easily makes my day better and my healing from a part of my previous trauma is seeing how far he has come in his career is inspiring me to work on my dreams, ventures, and endeavors. I honestly feel like I am his number one fan. I do not care what he does or who he is with, I support him with everything, and I hope to meet him one day. Please like so he sees this!!!",

        "25:14 correction getting baptized makes you a child of god and is one of the moments you get closest to god until you get confirmed and also being Catholic and Christian are basically the same thing, if you believe that Jesus died on the cross for our sins and the 3rd day he rose again to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom shall have no end, you’re a Christian, y’all are talking about Catholic and Protestant Christian’s, the biggest difference is 1. That Catholics believe the bread and wine is Jesus’s actual blood and body while most Protestants believe it’s a symbol 2. The music, if you go to a Catholic Church they sing chants and hymns unless you’re norva Soto catholic they listen to music like the Protestants which is praise and worship which has like the guitar and shit meanwhile traditional Catholics have a choir and use a piano like instrument I don’t remember the name of 3. One more difference is that Catholics celebrate more traditions than Protestants. Ya and one more thing is that it wasn’t called Christianity until Matin Luther left the Catholic Church in the 1500’s because there was corruption so he was making a new church but left out a few books in the Bible and got rid of the original traditions from the church and just started modernizing which messed up they way people are supposed to worship god the father and Jesus the son of god. And before it was called Christianity it was called just Catholicism. If I got some stuff wrong please correct me.",

I know everyone is not perfect, yet the lust of the flesh and eyes, and the pride of life will keep a person from not only growing in the Lord, but vanity could keep someone out of the kingdom. Also, as a representative of Christ, it's important to watch your speech and typically avoid using profanity or any other vulgarity. If this is a struggle, that's fine.

This gift cannot be earned through good deeds or by simply being \"good\" (Ephesians 2:8; 1 Timothy 1:9). It is a matter of faith (acting out on what you believe according to God's Word concerning salvation). \n\nIf you have come here looking for a change in your life, if you have come seeking a peace that is found only through a personal relationship with a loving God, then you are at the right place. God is ready and willing to help you right now, and right where you are. \n\nPray this prayer: \n\nHeavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, \"Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved\" (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You. I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10. \"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\" I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.          \n\nIf you have prayed this prayer, welcome to the family of God.",

My only nitpick about the whole thing is that he didn't really do any of the side content until it was needed. I understand not doing Arkham City Side Missions or Origins DLC but he could of at least played Arkham Knight DLC Missions or Expansion stories with Harley, Batgirl or Red Hood, which would have been exciting for Kai to play through. But it was telling that he wanted to finish this marathon before the 26th (Duke's Birthday) so he didn't really give that extra content a try which is disappointing. But nonetheless, W marathon! 🔥",

        "Origins is a good game—I accept that it doesn’t add anything new to the gameplay—but man, the soundtrack, the characters, the story… those things are absolute masterpieces.\n\nHowever, since the development of Origins in 2012, it was planned to be a copy-paste of Arkham City because Warner ordered another game to extend the FOMO of Arkham City while Rocksteady was working on Arkham Knight. But Warner gave the team a deadline that wasn’t enough to implement everything they wanted, like new combat moves based on a younger Batman who lacked experience fighting criminals, new gadgets instead of just copying those from Arkham City, and even drones and medics like in Arkham Knight. The last ones were removed because Rocksteady was working on the same mechanics.\n\nIn short, if Warner had given the team enough time—about two more years—Origins could have been an amazing game. But we didn’t get that, and that’s the harsh reality.",

Each game in the series holds up great and has honestly aged like fine wine, the only negative I could really say is the repetitiveness of the boss fight's in the first two games, but so much makes up for that it isn't a deal breaker whatsoever.",

        "Yk damn well deep inside Kai was like\"man kendrick might be better then drake\"",
        "People wondering what kendrick was trying to symbolize. So basically the person who picks who gets the be the performer of the Super bowl is Jayz and the NFL team. Drake and  Jayz are not  on good terms. (Some fall out that happened with lil wayne and jayz). \nSo let's get into it. kendrick  states \"sometimes you gotta pop out and show\". Meaning he feels like Drake has belittled  him, so he needs to stand up and show him. \"Certified boogie man im the one that up the score\" meaning he is the one with the most wins in their little beef now.\n\"They tried to rig the game but you cant fake influence\" when he says rig its not really a rig but more about drake coming down on NFL for allowing someone to desicrate his image through their platform. And so most people thought kendrick could not perform They Not Like Us at the super bowl without everyone getting sued. Well someone found a loop hole, and thats why its good to know, influencial people. So usually The NFL's entertainment team creates a shortlist of potential performers based on factors like genre, cultural impact, and showmanship. The host city then has a say in the final decision, and sometimes there's an emphasis on local ties or making a bigger statement. \"Too loud, too reckless\" this what they referred to kendrick music as (It goes deeper than just kendrick too).\n\"Its a cultural devide imma get it on the floor\" We have been long devided, be it race, color or culture. Kendrick is saying he will bridge that gap (Through music as its natural we all see music in different perspectives, usually rap is seen as vulgar and violent) he wants to change that perspective.\nThere is a lot more to speak on but some of these are the main questions.  Most of the song is really just Kendrick being petty and dissing drake. And basically telling him, he deserves to be where he is right now( as some of you may know, Drake helped Kendrick debut). Some see it as back stabbing but its a known fact that Drake takes advantage of other artist sometimes. Its not unusual to see someone fall out with him.",

All she does is interrupt everything to make it about her. She’s so dramatic and tries so hard to be so theatrical or emotional literally Everytime they ever see eachother. I have never seen a clip of his mom ever where she wasn’t being a clout chaser as if she’s trying to get constant screen time or talk time. Like it was only cute once. Is he never gonna tell his mom to stop leeching and stop using his name for clout? Kai was going on about how much this meant to him and explaining everything and his mom just comes in and ruins the whole flow by making it about herself as if he needed her to say all that? doesn’t he worry that she’s gonna end up causing him to lose connects because of how much she boasts him and tries to wedge herself into things? She literally tries to tell us how she’s viewed. She says things like “everyone loves me right? They all love me right? I’m the cool mom right? I’m the cool mom everyone loves right? You made me a celebrity!” Truth is she’s not someone I think that should be in the lime light. Let Kai be Kai. She should be a mom to him and stop getting so caught up in being famous off of her son and not go around behind his back randomly telling strangers that she’s Kai cenats mom just for clout. It’s not fair to him Kai deserves better for having given his mom so much now.",

His skibbidi aura is not just about being part of the culture; it's about actively shaping it.\n\n**Infinite Rizz:**\n\n\"Rizz\" or charisma, in the context of Kai Cenat, transcends traditional definitions, morphing into what can only be described as \"infinite rizz.\" This is his boundless charm, adaptability, and influence across diverse platforms and contexts.\n\n- **Personality and Presence:** Kai's rizz is palpable in his infectious energy, his ability to make anyone laugh or feel included.

It's more than just hair; it's a statement of identity in the digital realm where visuals matter.\n\n- **Cultural Impact:** Kai's hairstyle has influenced countless young men to adopt similar cuts, making \"the Kai Cenat cut\" a sought-after style in barbershops. It's a testament to how personal choices in appearance can transcend into cultural trends.\n\n- **Symbol of Cool:** The low taper fade, maintained with precision and often with variations like texture or color, reinforces Kai's image as someone at the forefront of style, effortlessly blending traditional barbershop techniques with contemporary flair.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nKai Cenat doesn't just embody skibbidi aura, infinite rizz, and a low taper fade; he elevates these elements into a cohesive identity that resonates deeply within internet culture.

        "The Porsche 911 is one of the most enduring and iconic sports cars ever created. Introduced in 1964 by the German automaker Porsche, it has become a symbol of engineering excellence, performance, and timeless design. Over its decades-long history, the 911 has continually evolved while maintaining its distinctive character and connection to its roots. Few cars can match its legacy or its ability to captivate enthusiasts and casual observers alike.\n\nThe origins of the Porsche 911 trace back to its predecessor, the Porsche 356. By the early 1960s, it became clear that the 356 needed a successor that could offer better performance, modern styling, and advanced engineering. The new car, initially designated as the Porsche 901, debuted at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show. A legal dispute with Peugeot over the use of a three-digit naming convention with a “0” in the middle prompted Porsche to rename the car the 911. Despite the change, the 911 quickly established itself as a revolutionary vehicle that combined practicality with sports car performance.\n\nFrom its inception, the Porsche 911 was characterized by its rear-engine layout, air-cooled flat-six engine, and distinctive design. The first generation, known as the 911 Classic, remained in production until 1989, undergoing numerous updates to improve performance and handling. Early models produced modest power, but their lightweight construction and precise engineering made them a joy to drive. Over time, innovations such as fuel injection, turbocharging, and improved suspension systems were introduced, solidifying the 911’s reputation as a high-performance machine.\n\nOne of the defining moments in the 911’s history was the introduction of the 911 Turbo in 1975. Also known as the 930, this model featured a turbocharged engine that significantly increased power output and introduced a new level of performance to the 911 lineup. The Turbo became an icon in its own right, with its flared wheel arches, distinctive whale-tail spoiler, and exhilarating driving experience. It set a standard for performance that subsequent generations of the 911 have continued to uphold.\n\nThe transition from air-cooled to water-cooled engines in 1998 marked another pivotal moment in the 911’s evolution. The 996 generation was the first to adopt this change, which improved cooling efficiency and allowed for higher power outputs. While some purists lamented the move away from air-cooled engines, the 996 introduced significant advancements in technology and performance. It also represented a more modern approach to design, with sleeker lines and a more refined interior.\n\nThroughout its history, the 911 has maintained its unique silhouette, characterized by its sloping roofline, pronounced fenders, and compact proportions. Despite the changes in technology and design over the years, Porsche has remained committed to preserving the essence of the original model. Each generation has managed to strike a balance between honoring tradition and embracing innovation. The 911’s design is instantly recognizable and serves as a benchmark for automotive styling.\n\nThe 911 has also enjoyed tremendous success in motorsports, further cementing its legacy. From endurance racing at Le Mans to rally competitions and GT championships, the 911 has proven its versatility and performance capabilities on the global stage. Models like the 911 Carrera RS, 911 GT2, and 911 GT3 have been developed with racing in mind, bringing track-ready performance to the streets. These motorsport achievements have not only enhanced the car’s reputation but also contributed to its continuous development.\n\nCulturally, the Porsche 911 holds a unique place in the automotive world. It is a car that transcends generational and geographic boundaries, appealing to enthusiasts of all ages and backgrounds. Its status as a symbol of success, sophistication, and driving pleasure has made it a favorite among celebrities, collectors, and everyday drivers alike. Few cars have managed to maintain such universal appeal over such a long period.\n\nThe Porsche 911’s ability to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing automotive landscape is a testament to its exceptional design and engineering. While many cars come and go, the 911 has remained relevant by evolving with the times while staying true to its roots. Its blend of performance, luxury, and usability is unmatched, and its legacy continues to inspire new generations of enthusiasts.\n\nAs the automotive industry shifts toward electrification and sustainable technologies, the future of the Porsche 911 will undoubtedly involve further innovation. Porsche has already begun to explore hybrid and electric powertrains, and it is likely that these advancements will be integrated into the 911 lineup in the coming years. However, one thing is certain: the Porsche 911 will continue to be a symbol of automotive excellence, cherished by those who appreciate its unique combination of history, performance, and timeless design. It is more than just a car—it is a legend that has shaped the world of sports cars and will undoubtedly continue to do so for generations to come.",

        "> ** ``` [><] Experiment 2007, also known as C.O.D.E or more professionally, V.O.R.E.S Can bend anything in his hand at will. He has shown behaviors of trying to escape, and every time he has got better at it. When it was first created ten years ago, we were going to destroy it before [REDACTED] told us not to. One time, when 2007 tried to escape he turned an employee into a monster. The monster attacked and almost killed a couple men, so we then threw 2007 into the prison down below. It was made just for him. He was trapped in the caves, forever, but someone, or something left a knife in there, and that’s when he learned he could travel through dimensions with just one sharp item. He opened up a crack in reality, and we noticed a shockwave that knocked out all our power. But one of our cameras stayed on, and it was taken with him. It was a bit buggy, but it was the place that he was in, only in flames. Then the camera went offline. 2007 came back that night, and we locked him up inside a room made of Elinium. He never escaped, that was until the breakout happened. He was the leader of the breakout, someone stabbed him in the stomach, and the room and the caves were destroyed trapping all the security and the employees inside. We figured out that nothing was enough and we couldn’t stop him, so, one night we let him go. He took 2006 who was with him since Day one. Those two, will no doubt cause trouble for us. -[REDACTED] [><] ``` **",

        "Story time\n\nTimmy woke up early in the morning, feeling a bit hungry, and realized he needed to go to the store to buy some groceries, so he quickly got out of bed, brushed his teeth, put on his favorite blue hoodie, and grabbed his wallet before heading out the door, stepping onto the sidewalk where the sun was shining brightly, casting long shadows on the pavement as he walked down the street toward the local grocery store, enjoying the cool breeze that rustled the leaves of the trees lining the sidewalk while he passed by a group of kids riding their bikes, waving at them as he continued his journey, thinking about what he needed to buy, making a mental list that included milk, eggs, bread, and maybe a snack or two, but as he walked, he remembered that his mom had asked him to pick up some vegetables, so he decided to add carrots and tomatoes to his list, feeling proud of himself for being responsible, and when he finally reached the store, he grabbed a shopping basket from the entrance, taking a moment to appreciate the automatic sliding doors that whooshed open as he stepped inside, instantly greeted by the cool air conditioning that provided a refreshing contrast to the warmth outside, and he made his way to the dairy aisle, where he picked up a carton of milk, carefully checking the expiration date before placing it in his basket, then moving on to the bread section, where he debated between white and whole wheat but ultimately chose the healthier option, feeling good about his decision, before heading toward the produce section, where he found fresh, bright orange carrots and plump red tomatoes, selecting the best ones and placing them carefully in his basket, and as he turned to leave, he passed by the snack aisle and couldn't resist grabbing a bag of his favorite chips, convincing himself that a small treat wouldn't hurt, then he made his way to the checkout counter, waiting patiently in line behind an elderly woman who was chatting with the cashier, smiling as he listened to their conversation about the weather, and when it was finally his turn, he placed his items on the conveyor belt, watching as the cashier scanned each one, feeling satisfied that he had remembered everything, then pulling out his wallet to pay, handing over a few bills and receiving his change along with a receipt, thanking the cashier before picking up his bag and heading toward the exit, stepping outside into the warm sunlight once more, and as he walked back home, he felt a sense of accomplishment, knowing that he had successfully completed his errand, and when he finally arrived home, he set the groceries on the kitchen counter, taking a moment to put everything away properly before grabbing his bag of chips and plopping onto the couch, feeling happy that he had taken care of his responsibilities while also treating himself, realizing that sometimes even a simple trip to the store could feel like a little adventure.",

A subsonic flying wing with a crew of two, the plane was designed by Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) as the prime contractor, with Boeing, Hughes, and Vought as principal subcontractors, and was produced from 1987 to 2000.[1][4] The bomber can drop conventional and thermonuclear weapons,[5] such as up to eighty 500-pound class (230 kg) Mk 82 JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen 2,400-pound (1,100 kg) B83 nuclear bombs.

From what I know is that the current of this river is extremely strong so the bodies that get dumped wind up just getting washed away. 😓😓",

Your story inspires me to believe that anything is possible with dedication and persistence. Thank you, Kai, for being such a positive influence and making your fans feel like anything is achievable!"

Kendrick evolved sounds, drake did, carti did, yeat did, young thug did, future did, even nba youngboy did. They all had eras of different music but baby just sorta had the come up era, the main stream era and now hes just sorta there. Hes always gonna get respect for the bangers hes put out and the features hes taken songs over with but ion think he will move further if he dosnt change his flow and sound. Were sort of at that standstill where we already know what to expect when he drops and until we get something new the anticipation wont be there anymore like it once was.",

        "The Gospel\n\nThe entire Bible centers on a single, surprisingly simple theme: God loves you so much that He made a way to be forgiven for every sin, so you can spend eternity with Him. That’s the essence of the gospel, and the central subject of the Scriptures. The written Word of God is intended to help us understand this “good news.” By studying the Bible, we learn that each person needs to be saved (Romans 3:23), each person can be saved (Romans 1:16), and God wants each person to be saved (2 Peter 3:9).\n\nWhat separates us from God is sin. No matter how good we think we are, every person is guilty of sin (1 John 1:10). Since God is absolutely perfect, no one deserves to spend eternity in heaven. Instead, we deserve to be separated from Him forever (Romans 5:16). No amount of effort, no good deeds, no money, no talent, no achievements are enough to take away this guilt (Isaiah 64:6). Fortunately, God doesn’t want us to be separated from Him, so He made a way to fix what’s broken (John 3:16-17).\n\nThat one and only way is through faith in Jesus Christ (John 14:6). God Himself came to earth, as a human, living a perfect and sinless life (Hebrews 4:15). He willingly died as a sacrifice to pay the debt for our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). According to the Scriptures, anyone can be “saved”—forgiven by God and guaranteed heaven—through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 10:13). This isn’t a call for blind, ignorant belief (Acts 17:11; 1 John 4:1). It’s an invitation from the Holy Spirit to submission and trust (James 4:7). It’s a choice to let go of everything else in order to rely entirely on God.\n\nThere is nothing anyone can “do” in order to be saved. The only way a person can find salvation is by accepting Jesus Christ as their savior. This simply means believing that…\n\nI am a sinner, who deserves God’s judgment (Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23).\n\n\n\nJesus Christ is God, and He came to earth as a man (John 1:14).\n\n\n\nJesus died, in my place, in order to pay for my sins (Romans 8:3-4; Hebrews 10:14).\n\n\n\nJesus came back from the dead, as He said He would (Romans 4:25; Mark 8:31).\n\n\n\nI am trusting in Jesus’ sacrifice, and nothing else, in order to save me (Ephesians 2:8-9; John 3:5).\n\n\n\nAs best I know how, I am turning away from my sins, putting all of my faith (trust) in Jesus to save me (2 Corinthians 7:10; Acts 16:31).\n\n\n\nThat’s it! Anyone who truly believes those things is forgiven, changed from the inside out (James 1:18; 2 Corinthians 5:17), and destined for heaven. The gospel is simple enough for anyone to understand (Matthew 18:13), but very difficult for people to accept (Romans 1:20-21). The truth of the gospel means we are not perfect. We are not in total control of our lives (Psalm 39:5). We cannot save ourselves. We need something “more” than us to make things right (1 Thessalonians 4:8).\n\nBecoming a Christian is not about being better than others. The gospel is for those who admit they are weak and need to be rescued (2 Corinthians 12:9). That’s a hard truth, but everything we learn from the Bible proves this truth. Each theme explored in Scripture points towards this gospel message of sin, redemption, and salvation through faith.\n\nIt’s the most important decision a person will ever make: do I accept what God offers, or do I turn my back on it (Matthew 7:13)?\n\nWhich one will you choose (2 Corinthians 6:2)?",

        "Did anyone notice around the 5:30  mark when they're checking the girls' room? You can see a little girl walk by in the background of the other room.....that gave me chills",
        "He kept saying he didn’t do anything to the kids but never his wife",
        "The crazy thing is that he said at first, she was still asleep in the morning, so how couldn’t her and him have that conversation about having the marital discord before he left in the morning",
        "They didn't need that lie detector test at all. Matter fact, it wasnt even plugged in. Omg bruh 😳 all that stuff he said about what him his wife were talking about the morning she disappeared, got him caught",
        "He said she takes her ring off to color her hair instead of die her hair because he didnt wanna associate those words in that setting. I watched the unedit body cam so many times there alot of flags in that trimming.",

        "Absolutely, Bob Marley is a white man and so is Druski with his beige skin. We have a responsibility to maintain the pureness of the brown and black race without beige skin interferance. If Druski want s to bleach iz skin that is his choice. You cannat have your cake and eat it too. If your brown skin is a badge of shame and you decide to do that, that is your skin you can do what you want to it. As a brown skin black indian woman, I have a responsibilty to maintain the browness and the blackness our the 2 different brown and black race. So we need to protect the indegeneous brown and black race that is going extinct, because there are way more beige skin ppl in the brown and black race than brown and black people. When you call beige skin people black it is highly offensive, and it is causing depression, anxiety, fear, confusion, self hate, negative pshycological and emotional effects, anger, and stress. The black man is neglectin hz responsibilty of maintaining the pure colour of the brown and black race. It feels so powerless when people ignore the brown skin black indian little girls feelings of being replaced by beige skin people. We need the government to provide funding so th brown skin black indian girls can get medical attention for these issue that you people are causing. We are asking you to instantly stop calling beige skin people black people. Brown is brown. Black is black. beige is beige and white is white. plz stop instantly. This is not funny.",

        "I’m so confused why that even escalated, but if Kaysan just comes in to host the games. I would stop coming because they act immature and it’s a game you shouldn’t act like this. Even the way they don’t listen to him during the game is annoying. Dez has other stuff going as to why he lashes out, talking bout ppl dying, he’s clearly tense and on edge.",

Out of respect to his guest & to Kai’s career they should’ve saved it till they weren’t around. Making a big ass deal over a game is so embarrassing on god. Kai needs to leave certain people where they belong before they drag him down or embarrass him in a worse way. not everyone mentally grown enough to be given big opportunities of meeting & connecting with celebrities. this just a bunch of grown men who don’t know how to act fr. you can see the discomfort that altercation made lizzo & lil yatchy feel. I feel so bad for Kai, he even told them “ we have lizzo & yatchy here everyone relax “ mad disrespectful",

My emotions, broken heart, and pain will not let ANYTHING slide. I just want to give him a hug just because it’s millions of people judging what I believe to be a misunderstood man. Y’all need to chill and understand if Kai rocking with him then he good people. Sometimes y’all gotta chill with all those Ls y’all willing to label folks with.",

We all know your a pure and genuine soul and watching that stream made so so scared for you. Calling on his name then right after bopping your head with them nah gang that ain't you. I get doing things for entertainment purposes but you have to know and understand that people possess energy and it can manifest onto you without even knowing. Speak to your team gang and make sure that whomever you bring on there is a true representation of you are as a child of god. Know and understand that not everything needs to be for the internet. We love and support you no matter what so protect your peace king. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT allow space for darkness to enter.  Be careful who you interact with on stream dont just embrace it in the moment, i get the fact that you view it as a form of content however we all could see how uncomfortable  you felt on stream thats why you felt the need to pray and call on him.I hope and i pray this message finds you and that you make a full recovery.

        "It's called polyamory lol. It is possible, but not everyone is built for it... While I'm monogamous myself, I don't judge poly people just because it doesn't meet my standards or idea of dating.... that's their life to live and enjoy. I know some people personally that are poly and they figure it out. I think some people think poly relationships tend to be too complicated or a love triangle, but sometimes it's not and love triangles aren't relationships.\n\n Some people are poly, some people are monogamous- it doesn't make you morally or ethically superior than the other. Monogamous couples still cheat and being in a poly relationship doesn't mean you have trouble deciding who you want or you're greedy (it's not like they took them away from you).  Some poly relationships last longer too (apparently they can average 7 - 8 years). \n\nSome people are built to be monogamous, some are built to be polyamorous, some can do either or. Sometimes people have different styles, ways of living, beliefs, etc that may be different from yours or do things you don't get- doesn't mean it's bad. Also, chat is a bunch of 14 year olds why are they answering like they know lmao. \"1 in 6 people in the United States would like to engage in polyamorous relationships.\" Chat, some of you might make it in the stats lol.\n\nTL;DR yes, it is possible but you have to be mature enough to not just want it but handle/navigate it (some people try it out realizing it's not for them or have false pretenses). Being monogamous doesn't make you morally superior than a poly relationship. Just because you don't get it or wouldn't do it for yourself doesn't automatically make it bad.",
        "17:20 I wonder why chat's first reaction is to say \"cap\" when she says she never cheated.... is it projection from yourself or projection from an experience you're putting on other people? Because they know they have no logical reason to doubt her- it's just themselves making it up based on whatever vibes they imagine her having.",

        "This comment section is split between two opinions, people who like flow better and people who like the actual punch lines better, in my personal opinion, punchlines make a rapper much more valuable. Idc how much flow you have going on, if their is not story behind it or a comparison to something it just lacks life to me. With all due respect Frak when crazy and completely obliterated. there was a punchline in every single line. punchlines are more entertaining. It’s what gets people hype in rap battles. The flow doesn’t really matter. In a professional rap battle, people stop the rappers while screaming because of their punchlines not the flow. But to each their own ofc!",

        "Michael controlled not only Franklin but Trevor too from the start. Trevor was a mentally ill person who was discharged from the military due to a psychiatric evaluation. When Trevor was at his worst, Michael came along and showed him a life of lucrative crime—like the devil making a deal. Michael taught him to embrace his anger and trauma, turning him into the monster we see from the beginning to the end of the game.\n\nMichael also manipulates Franklin into killing Trevor, finishing the job he intended all the way back in North Yankton—to kill Trevor and forget his past. Alternatively, Franklin can kill Michael, ending the cycle of control and obligation. After making his choice, Franklin pulls out his phone and calls Lamar. It’s a perfect ending, leaving Trevor and Franklin independent, no longer cursed by the one who dragged them so deep into the life and so far from their roots.",

I guess curiosity and bravery are uniquely universal traits amongst white people (universal being a very important word here, since I am talking about generalities), which is why we explored and conquered the whole world. And I am aware of the fact that they exaggerated for the stream. I am talking about the fact that it is well-known that black people don't care much for things that don't directly benefit them materialistically, like bungie jumping, sky diving, or interacting with exotic animals. And I know this might sound racist, and it is, but only in the sense that I recognize and acknowlegde the differences between races. I love Kai though. He's a great guy and a genius when it comes to content. There's no way in hell I could do what he can do. And he seems like a genuinely good person.",
